## Learnings

I was never a fan of `CSS-in-JS`, my first impression of it was 'messy', 'unmantainable' and doesn't seem to enforce consistency. I may be wrong... It is indeed a powerful tool for styling and anything with JS is magical!  

Through this lesson, I learn how `styled-components` can be very powerful. To help enforce consistency, I utilise the `CSS variables` in the `GlobalStyles`. The styling components can defintely be seperated into its own styled files to improve DRY ness. This is by far not an advanced learning, but I look forward to continue growing in using it to create more modular and re-usable styled components. 

- `CSS-in-JS` ‚Üí `styled-components`
  - with conditional styling
  - implement CSS variables for consistency and maintainability
- `React Router Dom v6` with active `NavLink` 
- Theme toggle between two different themes
