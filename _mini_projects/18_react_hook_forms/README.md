### **Learnings**

Exploring the alternative to pure React forms for (complex) form creation and validations with *React Hook Forms*, *Yup*, and utilise *MUI*'s components for the UI. 

React Hook Form is very valuable for a fast integration with Yup validation. I can see how useful it is and why many people prefer it! However, in this learning, I find it quite difficult to integrate it with MUI without being too verbose with the codes (e.g. unable to use custom reusable components, I had to manually duplicate the `<TextField/>` component. Will explore how I can minimise code!)

- Yup form validation integration with the help of `@hookform/resolvers`
